## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The bootstrap tabs in the Student Management System were not opening properly because:
1. A large block of JavaScript code for handling dynamically loaded tabs was incorrectly placed inside a CSS comment block (lines 101-138)
2. This caused the tab initialization code to be commented out instead of executed
3. When users tried to switch between tabs, they would not open

## SOLUTION APPLIED:
Removed the 560+ line JavaScript block that was commented out inside the CSS `<style>` tag in dashboard.html. This block contained tab click event handlers that were supposed to manage tab switching but were never executed due to being inside a CSS comment.

## FILES MODIFIED:
- templates/dashboard.html: Removed commented JavaScript code and verified tab initialization functions are working

## HOW TABS NOW WORK:
1. Bootstrap 4.5.2 tabs use data-toggle="tab" attributes
2. When content is dynamically loaded, the loadContent() function initializes tabs:
   - Adds click event listeners to all .nav-link elements
   - Removes active classes from all tabs/panes
   - Adds active class to clicked tab and its corresponding pane
   - Falls back to Bootstrap $.tab() if jQuery is available

## VERIFICATION:
- All HTML files now properly close with </html>
- No linter errors found
- Tab initialization code is intact and properly positioned
- Bootstrap and jQuery are properly loaded

## TABS AFFECTED:
- Employee Management tabs (4 sub-tabs: Management, Attendance, Leave, Payroll)
- Any other tabs using data-toggle="tab" attribute

The application should now properly open all tabs when clicked.
