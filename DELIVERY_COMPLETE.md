  - JSON parsing
  - Success/error handling
  - Exception catching

#### 2. Teacher List Loader
- **Location:** lines 13774-13845
- **Purpose:** Refresh teacher list after save
- **Logging Added:**
  - List load start
  - API URL
  - Response status
  - Teacher count
  - Error handling

#### 3. Toast Notification

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Testing (5 minutes)
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to Master Data Management → Teacher
3. Add test teacher with valid data
4. Check console for [TEACHER] logs
5. Verify success message and teacher in list

### For Troubleshooting
1. Look for [TEACHER] logs in console
2. Find where logs stop (indicates failure point)
3. Check TEACHER_ACCOUNT_CREATION_DEBUGGING.md for that scenario
4. Follow the solution provided

### For Development
1. Review TEACHER_ACCOUNT_CREATION_COMPLETE_REPORT.md
2. Understand logging pattern
3. Apply similar pattern to other forms if needed
4. Reference documentation for guidance
